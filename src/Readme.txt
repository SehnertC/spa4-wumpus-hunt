IDE -> Clion
Version -> C++ 17

Special instructions:
Navigate to build configurations and enable “Emulate terminal in the output console” or any equivalent in the standard terminal if not enabled by default.

Design variations:
The original plan was to make the magic orb act like an arrow with bounce physics but I instead made it reveal hazards on the map.
The trapdoor was also planned to make the user loose items but I’ve decided to link it to other trapdoor rooms instead.
Arrows don’t respawn.
